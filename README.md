## What is Smithy?

Smithy is a framework for writing WebAssembly applications entirely in Rust. Its goal is to allow you to do so using idiomatic Rust, without giving up any of the compiler's safety guarantees.

## Smithy works on nightly

Smithy v0.0.6 currently works on `rustc 1.37.0-nightly (5f9c0448d 2019-06-25)`.

The master branch has been updated to work on `rustc 1.39.0-nightly (dfd43f0fd 2019-09-01)`.

## Getting started

Getting started in Smithy is easy!

```sh
npm init smithy-app my_smithy_app
cd my_smithy_app
npm start
